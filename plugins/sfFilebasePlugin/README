sfFilebase provides an unified API for filesystem-related operations with focus on web-based applications.

It consists off a set of classes based on build-in SPL-file-classes (SplFileInfo/-Object, DirectoryIterator ...). It tries to fix the lack of the build-in SPL-Classes by dissociating different types of files. So there are classes like FilebaseDirectory, FilebaseImage, FilebaseObject, FilebaseThumbnail... planning FilebaseZIP or something like that.

sfFilebase can help you if you want to

*  upload files

*  retrieve files from filesystem

*  read/write/execute files

*  do core fs-operations like chmod, mkdir, touch ...

*  render appropriate file-name conversions (/var/www/files/images/image.jpg to
   /files/images/image.jpg); imagine you have a temp dir to store uploaed preview
   images and want to display them to the client in a one-line-code segment.
*  manipulate images, generating thumbnails (please help to implement much more

   image-manipulation capabilities) including cached file management
