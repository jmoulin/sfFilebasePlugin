This is a stub symfony project, the plugin can be found unter ./plugins/sfFilebasePlugin.

Under ./apps you'll find a small sample application for demo/documentation purpose.

To install the plugin via symfony task, refer to the README or browse [http://symfony-project.org/plugins/sfFilebasePlugin](the symfony plugin site).

There is also an svn repos to be found at the symfony plugins site. This one is used by me. I'll try to setup both repositories up-to-date, but the bot
is me ;)

Have fun!
